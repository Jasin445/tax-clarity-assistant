# Tax Clarity Assistant

Tax Clarity Assistant is a lightweight web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that helps Nigerians understand how the 2026 tax reforms apply to them.

The product focuses on clarity, speed, and confidence — not legal jargon or complex tools.

## Problem

Nigeria’s 2026 tax reforms introduced changes affecting freelancers, small business owners, and individuals with multiple income streams.

Official guidance is difficult to understand, leading to confusion, fear of penalties, and missed exemptions.

The application asks users a small number of simple questions and generates:

- A personalized summary of how the tax reform applies to them
- What has changed compared to previous rules
- A clear checklist of what to do next

All explanations are written in plain language and designed to be completed in under five minutes.
